The idea behind creating this study is to verify the relationship between work arrangements (remote, hybrid, or in-person) and satisfaction with the company along with some variables: race/ethnicity, gender, Brazilian state, education level, and salary range.  

Summary  

The work model - remote, hybrid, or in-person - has proven to be a relevant factor for the experience and retention of data professionals, as revealed in the 2022 State of Data survey.  

It would be interesting to further analyze the interaction between work formats and other key variables, such as satisfaction with current employment, average compensation, and diversity among professionals.  

Some hypotheses that could be tested:  

- Professionals in a 100% remote model show greater satisfaction due to schedule and location flexibility.  
- Women and racial minorities are more satisfied and better compensated in remote models, by reducing unconscious biases related to physical presence.  
- There is greater racial and gender diversity among fully remote professionals versus fully in-person.  
- Remote work increases access to opportunities outside major centers, improving regional diversity.  
- Which salary range is most satisfied in terms of work flexibility.  
- Which education level is most satisfied in terms of work flexibility.
